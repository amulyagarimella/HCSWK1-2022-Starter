						<h1>Research</h1>
						<h2 class="subheader">Current projects</h2>
						<p>I've had the incredible opportunity to work at the <a href=http://pfenninglab.org target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neurogenomics Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University for the past three years. Currently, I'm working on finding blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease. My work has been featured in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/01/30/Student-16-stands-out-as-high-tech-researcher-Amulya-Garimella-cmu/stories/202001230158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Post Gazette</a>.</p>
						<p>During the summer of 2019, I attended the <a href="http://hillmanacademy.upmc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UPMC Hillman Cancer Center Academy</a>, an eight-week summer program that allows high school students to research in labs with dedicated mentors. Over the eight weeks, I conducted research on Alzheimer's blood biomarkers in the Neurogenomics Lab, with my mentors, Dr. Andreas Pfenning and Easwaran Ramamurthy. The program  culminated in a presentation and poster session, and <a href= "assets/files/hillmanAcademyPoster_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my poster here.</a> I've been working on this project for over a year now, and it's been really exciting!</p>
						<p>I also had the opportunity to serve as a reviewer for <a href="https://www.amia.org/amia2020" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">AMIA 2020</a>.</p>
						<p>In addition, I'm conducting research into cognitive reserve, or natural resilience against the neurodegeneration that can occur through disease and aging. I built a machine learning model to predict cognitive reserve from gene expression and used it to identify potential biomarkers that we can potentially target in future treatments for Alzheimer's and similar diseases. I presented preliminary results at the 2019 Covestro Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair, and won 4th place in the Senior Biology Division. <a href="assets/files/PRSEFPoster_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can see my poster (formatted for a trifold display) here.</a></p>
						<p></p>
						<h2 class="subheader">Past projects</h2>
						<p>In eighth and ninth grade, I conducted research on the development of memory in humans as it related to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. I won the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvw7d8HOBEg target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carnegie Science Award in the Intermediate Division</a> for my project in 2017, as well as the 1st place award at the Covestro Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair in the Intermediate Biology Division, and, in 2018, 2nd place in the Senior Biology Division. <a href="assets/files/PRSEFPoster_2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can see the poster that I presented (formatted for a trifold display) here</a>.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>In middle school, I was selected as one of 10 finalists and won 3rd place in the national <a href=https://www.youngscientistlab.com/entry/15 target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovery 3M Young Scientist Challenge</a> for a project where I built a wearable bracelet that would interact with a commercial EEG headset to detect distraction through brainwave signals. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tee7Bn-3qRM target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can watch my final presentation here</a>. For my work, I was <a href=http://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=516088141889175 target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognized on the floor of the US Congress by PA Congressman Keith Rothfus</a> and also got to talk about it on <a href=http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/10/24/top-young-scientists-discover-3mm-show-inventions-will-make-you-feel-better-about-future target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox and Friends</a>.
