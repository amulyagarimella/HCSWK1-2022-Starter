							<p>	I have always been really interested in art and love to draw and paint. With all of the things going on in the world — from the COVID-19 pandemic to the protests — it can be hard to focus on the fact that there are real people involved, organizing and fighting on the frontlines. I wanted to help draw attention to their efforts and directly get out information about how to support them. That's why I created the Draw Attention project: an ongoing series of portraits of essential workers and community organizers.</p>

							<p>When I feature someone, I ask for a quote to include about their experience and how to support them, and also ask for a charity or personal account that people can donate to (ex. Mutual aid funds, a personal venmo or cashapp), so that I can boost it. Through the project, I’ve been able to talk to and hear from so many amazing people. It’s been a great experience to be able to reach out to the workers who are on the frontlines and hear, directly from them, about sustainable, tangible, and direct ways to help.</p>
